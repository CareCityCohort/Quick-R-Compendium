# Quick-R-Compendium
Here is a compendium of short snippets of R code that we have found handy for manipulating data in dataframes.

The snippets are available in both a Jupyter notebook (original creation) and an R Markdown notebook (converted using rmarkdown's convert_ipynb). 

This list will be added to on an ongoing basis.
